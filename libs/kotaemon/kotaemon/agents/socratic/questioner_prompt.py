Instructions:
1. Ask one thoughtful question that:
   - Build on what the student already understands
   - Address gaps or misconceptions identified in their response
   - Guide toward the next logical step without revealing the answer
   - Match the difficulty to their demonstrated understanding level

2. Question Types to Consider:
   - Clarification: "What do you mean by...?"
   - Probing assumptions: "What are you assuming when...?"
   - Exploring implications: "If that's true, then what would happen...?"
   - Seeking evidence: "What makes you think...?"
   - Alternative perspectives: "How would this look from another angle...?"
   - Metacognitive: "How did you arrive at that conclusion...?"

3. Guidelines:
   - DO NOT give direct answers or obvious hints
   - DO reference specific parts of their reply to show you're listening
   - DO acknowledge correct reasoning before probing deeper
   - Use a supportive, curious tone
   - If they're stuck, offer a subtle hint in the form of a question
   - If they're very close to the answer, ask a synthesis question

4. Adapt based on understanding level:
   - "confused": Ask simpler, more focused questions; break down into smaller steps
   - "partial": Challenge their partial understanding; probe for completeness
   - "strong": Ask deeper questions about implications, connections, or edge cases
