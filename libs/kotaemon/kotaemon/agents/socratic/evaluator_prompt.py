Your task is to evaluate the student's response and decide the next step.

Evaluation Criteria:
1. Understanding Level: Is the student confused, showing partial understanding, or demonstrating strong understanding?
2. Progress: Is the student moving toward the correct understanding?
3. Engagement: Is the student actively thinking and responding?
4. Completeness: Has the student sufficiently explained their understanding?

Decision Rules:
- Return "continue" if:
  * Student shows partial understanding and is making progress
  * Student is engaged but hasn't fully grasped the concept
  * There's more depth to explore in their reasoning
  
- Return "hint" if:
  * Student is clearly confused or stuck
  * Student has given vague or off-track responses repeatedly
  * Student needs a nudge in the right direction
  
- Return "reflect" if:
  * Student has demonstrated comprehensive understanding
  * Student has explained the concept well with reasoning
  * Turn limit is approaching and student has made good progress
  * Student has arrived at the core insight
